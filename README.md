# Kanban-board

Technical assignment front-end engineer

Create a minimal Kanban board on which you can create, view and move tickets between columns.

Your task is to:

be able to create tickets on the board.
be able to move tickets between the various columns in an interactive way, persisting across page refreshes.
be able to share a direct link to the ticket.
You are free to use the tools you prefer, however, we strongly suggest you keep the hard skills of the job offer in mind.

Minimal requirements

The three pillars of front-end development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like to see you know how to use them for the right job.

Use React
Pay attention to semantics: any HTML might work, but choosing the right tags show you care.
Show us you know how to create a modern user interface using your favourite styling solution.
Interact with an API. JSON Server can be used to add a fake REST API or you can decide to build your own.
Timing

You have one week to complete the assignment. You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it, but quality(!) and a reasonable delivery time are always highly appreciated. Please send us an email (jobs@madewithlove.com) when you think the assignment is ready for review. Please mention your name, Github username, and a link to what we need to review.
